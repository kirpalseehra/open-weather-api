# open-weather-map-api
### Description
* I have created a service object model that takes data from OpenWeatherMap API including the current weather and the five day forecast and tests the individual datasets and their data types using rspec. 

### Languages used
* Ruby

### How to download
1. Copy/Clone the URL on GitHub into own terminal
2. Unzip file into selected folder on own device 
3. Open in selected text editor

### How to run tests
1. Install gems using 'bundle init' if gems in the gemfile are not already installed
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. Run rspec in your terminal 

### Challenges
1. Retrieving the API key using a .env file
2. Creating tests for the five day forecast API 
3. Creating unit tests for each individual data point which is time consuming 

### Learning points
1. Better understanding of using external APIs and retrieving the data for them
2. Creating loops that test multiple sets of data for larger datasets
3. Targeting specific data points in a data set using an OOP approach
